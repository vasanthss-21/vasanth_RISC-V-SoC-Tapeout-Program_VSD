## 🎯 Welcome to the World of Chip Design!

Ever wondered how a simple idea transforms into a tiny silicon chip that powers your smartphone? Today, we're diving into the fascinating journey of **RTL to GDSII** - the complete process that takes a digital circuit description and converts it into a physical layout ready for fabrication! 

Think of it as transforming architectural blueprints into an actual building, but at a microscopic scale! 🏗️→💎

---

## 1. Understanding the VLSI Design Flow & Fundamentals

### 🔄 The RTL to GDSII Flow: Your Roadmap to Silicon

The RTL to GDSII flow is like a pipeline where your design goes through multiple transformations, each adding more detail and bringing you closer to the final chip layout.



### 🌀 The Y-Chart: Three Dimensions of Design

The **Y-Chart** is a fundamental concept in VLSI showing how design flows through three interconnected domains:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Behavioral Domain<br/>What it does] --> D[Design Flow]
    B[Structural Domain<br/>How it works] --> D
    C[Physical Domain<br/>Where things are] --> D
    D --> E[Final Chip]
```

All three views must stay synchronized throughout the design process - change one, and you need to update the others!

## 🎯 Welcome to Day 2!

Yesterday, we completed synthesis and obtained our gate-level netlist. Today, we're taking the next exciting step—**Floorplanning**! This is where we decide how to organize our chip's real estate. Think of it as being an architect planning where each room goes in a house before construction begins! 🏗️

A good floorplan can make or break your design—it affects timing, power consumption, and even whether your chip will work at all!

---

## 1. Floorplan Fundamentals

### 🗺️ What is Floorplanning?

Floorplanning is the foundation of physical design where we:
- 📐 Define chip dimensions (die area and core area)
- ⚡ Plan power distribution networks (PDN)
- 📍 Place I/O pins strategically
- 🎯 Reserve areas for macros and standard cells

> 💡 **Think of it this way:** If your chip is a city, floorplanning is urban planning—deciding where roads, power lines, and buildings go before construction begins!

### 🎯 Floorplan Quality Metrics

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Floorplan Quality] --> B[Area Metrics]
    A --> C[Power Planning]
    A --> D[I/O Strategy]
    A --> E[Routability]
    
    B --> B1[Utilization: 50-70%]
    B --> B2[Aspect Ratio: ~1.0]
    
    C --> C1[Core Ring]
    C --> C2[Power Stripes]
    
    D --> D1[Strategic Placement]
    D --> D2[Minimize Wire Length]
    
    E --> E1[Routing Channels]
    E --> E2[No Congestion]
```

**Key Formulas:**

```
Utilization Factor = (Area occupied by cells / Total core area) × 100%

Aspect Ratio = Height of Core / Width of Core

Good Floorplan = {Utilization: 50-70%, Aspect Ratio: 0.8-1.2, No congestion}
```

---

### ✅ Good vs Bad Floorplan

| Aspect | ✅ Good Floorplan | ❌ Bad Floorplan |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **📏 Utilization** | 50-70% (routing space available) | >80% (no routing space) |
| **📐 Aspect Ratio** | 0.8-1.2 (balanced) | >2.0 or <0.5 (timing skew) |
| **🔌 I/O Placement** | Strategic, near related logic | Random, crisscross connections |
| **⚡ Power Grid** | Core ring + adequate stripes (~150µm pitch) | Sparse, large pitch (IR drop) |
| **🎯 Macro Placement** | Based on connectivity | Blocking routing channels |
| **🛣️ Routing Channels** | Adequate space between rows | Congestion hotspots |
| **📦 Core Margin** | 2-5µm from die edge | Cells touching edge |

### ⚠️ Floorplan Red Flags

```
🚨 DANGER SIGNS:
   ├── Utilization > 85% → Routing nightmare ahead!
   ├── Aspect Ratio > 2.0 → Timing closure impossible
   ├── Overlapping macros → Physical violation
   ├── IR drop > 10% → Reliability failure
   └── Congestion > 80% → Design will not route
```

## 🧠 Phase 1: Circuit Design

### Example: 2-Input NAND Gate

```
Truth Table:          Circuit:
A  B │ Y                VDD
─────┼───               │
0  0 │ 1          ┌─────┴─────┐
0  1 │ 1          │           │
1  0 │ 1        [PMOS_A]   [PMOS_B]  ← Parallel (pull-up)
1  1 │ 0          │           │
                   └─────┬─────┘
                         Y
                         │
                   ┌─────┴─────┐
                   │           │
                 [NMOS_A]   [NMOS_B]  ← Series (pull-down)
                   │           │
                   └─────┬─────┘
                         │
                        GND
```

**Key Sizing Rules:**
- PMOS width = 2× NMOS (compensate lower mobility)
- Series NMOS = 2× wider (reduce resistance)
- Balance rise/fall times for symmetry

## ⚡ Step 5: SPICE Simulation with PySpice & Ngspice

Traditionally, SPICE simulations are executed using:

```bash
ngspice sky130_inv.spice
```

But instead of stopping there, I decided to **go a step further** 🎯 — I explored **PySpice**, a Python interface to Ngspice that allows programmatic control, automation, and in-depth waveform analysis.

This approach made it easier to run parameter sweeps, visualize transient behavior, and measure key timing parameters like rise/fall delays directly within Python.

You can find my **Jupyter Notebook** in the **`code/week6/`** directory, which contains all the simulation scripts and plots to **reproduce the results** seamlessly.

### 📊 Simulation Results

Here’s a glimpse of what I observed from the inverter simulation using the Sky130 PDK:

    style C fill:#e57373
    style D fill:#64b5f6
    style E fill:#ba68c8
```

---

### 1️⃣ Rise Time (tr)

**Definition:** Time for output to go from 20% to 80% of VDD

```
Measurements:
├─ 20% of 3.3V = 0.66V at t₀ = 6.16138 ns
└─ 80% of 3.3V = 2.64V at t₁ = 6.20366 ns

Rise Time = t₁ - t₀ = 0.0422 ns = 42.2 ps ✅
```

---

### 2️⃣ Fall Time (tf)

**Definition:** Time for output to go from 80% to 20% of VDD

```
Measurements:
├─ 80% of 3.3V = 2.64V at t₀ = 8.04034 ns
└─ 20% of 3.3V = 0.66V at t₁ = 8.06818 ns

Fall Time = t₁ - t₀ = 0.0278 ns = 27.8 ps ✅
```

---

### 3️⃣ Propagation Delay (tpLH)

**Definition:** 50% input → 50% output (Low to High transition)

```
Measurements:
├─ Input 50% = 1.65V at t₀ = 2.15000 ns
└─ Output 50% = 1.65V at t₁ = 2.18449 ns

Prop Delay = t₁ - t₀ = 0.034 ns = 34 ps ✅
```

---

### 4️⃣ Cell Fall Delay (tpHL)

**Definition:** 50% input → 50% output (High to Low transition)

```
Measurements:
├─ Input 50% = 1.65V at t₀ = 4.05001 ns
└─ Output 50% = 1.65V at t₁ = 4.05432 ns

Cell Fall Delay = t₁ - t₀ = 0.0043 ns = 4.3 ps ✅
```

---

## 📐 Step 7: Generate LEF File

### 🎯 Why LEF?

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Full GDS<br/>Layout] --> |Abstract| B[LEF File]
    B --> C[Place & Route]
    
    A --> |Contains| A1[Every polygon<br/>Every layer<br/>IP details]
    B --> |Contains| B1[Cell boundary<br/>Pin locations<br/>Blockages only]
    
    style A fill:#ef9a9a
    style B fill:#90caf9
    style C fill:#a5d6a7
```

**LEF = Physical abstract WITHOUT revealing internal design (IP protection!)**

---

### 📝 LEF File Requirements

Before creating LEF, ensure:

✅ **Grid alignment:** Cells must align to placement grid  
✅ **Track alignment:** Ports must be on routing tracks  
✅ **Standard height:** Cell height = multiple of track pitch  
✅ **Standard width:** Cell width = odd multiple of track pitch  
✅ **Port definitions:** All pins properly labeled

---

### 🛤️ Understanding Tracks

**Check track info:**

```bash
cat tracks.info
```

**Sample output:**

```
li1 X 0.23 0.46    # Metal1: X-direction, offset 0.23µm, pitch 0.46µm
li1 Y 0.17 0.34    # Metal1: Y-direction, offset 0.17µm, pitch 0.34µm
met1 X 0.17 0.34   # Metal2: X-direction
met1 Y 0.17 0.34   # Metal2: Y-direction
```

**What this means:**
- 🔹 **Pitch:** Distance between routing tracks
- 🔹 **Offset:** Starting position of first track
- 🔹 **Direction:** Preferred routing direction per layer

---

### 🎨 Verify Grid Alignment in Magic

```tcl
# In Magic tkcon window
grid 0.46um 0.34um 0.23um 0.17um
```

**This displays routing grid overlay on your layout**

**Check:**
- ✅ Input/output ports sit on grid intersections
- ✅ Cell width is odd multiple of X-pitch
- ✅ Cell height is odd multiple of Y-pitch

---

## 🎯 Overview {#overview}

This lab focuses on **pre-layout timing analysis** and demonstrates the critical importance of proper clock tree design in achieving timing closure. We'll integrate a custom inverter cell, perform detailed Static Timing Analysis (STA), optimize timing through various techniques, and implement Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS).

**Key Objectives:**
- ✅ Configure track-based grid for standard cell design
- ✅ Define ports and generate LEF files
- ✅ Integrate custom cell into OpenLane flow
- ✅ Perform pre-layout STA and timing optimization
- ✅ Execute Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
- ✅ Analyze post-CTS timing (Setup & Hold)

## 📐 Section 1: Track Configuration & Grid Setup

### 1.1 Understanding Track Specifications

**Track Definition:**
- Each track is placed at **0.46µm** along horizontal (X) direction
- Vertical (Y) direction tracks are at **0.34µm**
- Every metal layer has both X and Y direction tracks


### 1.2 Grid Dimensions Configuration

**📸 Grid Setup Command**

*Figure 1.2: Grid dimensions configured in Magic - setting up the layout grid to match track specifications*

**Important Rule:**
> 📏 **Width of standard cell must be ODD multiples of X-pitch (0.46µm)**

**Grid Configuration:**
```tcl
grid 0.46um 0.34um 0.23um 0.17um
```

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Purpose** |
|:--------------|:---------:|:------------|
| X-pitch | `0.46µm` | Horizontal routing pitch |
| Y-pitch | `0.34µm` | Vertical routing pitch |
| X-offset | `0.23µm` | Grid origin X offset |
| Y-offset | `0.17µm` | Grid origin Y offset |

## ✅ **4.12 Pre-Layout Static Timing Analysis (STA)**

Before moving to placement & routing, we must verify timing after synthesis.
This ensures our design meets the clock frequency requirement **before physical effects are introduced**.

### 🔧 **Run Pre-Layout STA**

```bash
sta pre_sta.conf
```

---

### 📸 **Initial Timing Report (Before Optimization)**

![image](Images/day4_sec5_min_sta.png)

*Figure 4.12: Initial STA report showing setup violations, slack calculations, and path delays*

---

### 📸 **Critical Path Breakdown**

![image](Images/day4_sec5_max_sta.png)

*Figure 4.13: Critical timing path showing cell and net delays contributing to worst slack*

---

## 🚀 **Synthesis Optimization for Better Timing**

We observed negative slack, so we **re-run synthesis with timing-focused strategies** to improve delay and reduce violations.

### 🎯 **Timing-Critical Synthesis Settings**

```tcl
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"        ;# Aggressive delay optimization
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1                  ;# Enable cell sizing for timing
set ::env(SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT) 4              ;# Reduce high fanout
set ::env(SYNTH_BUFFERING) 1               ;# Insert buffers where needed
run_synthesis
```

### 📸 **Re-Synthesis Output After Optimization**

![image](Images/day5_sec5-after_optimization_run-synth.png)

> Result: Drive strength adjusted, fanout reduced, timing improved.

---

## 🛠️ **4.18 Identifying & Fixing High-Delay Nets**

After synthesis, we further optimize timing by identifying **long delay paths** and **upsizing cells**.

Your script `Test_sta.conf` auto-detects high-delay cells, upsizes them, and generates a new Verilog netlist.
📁 *You will find this in `codes/week6/` folder.*

### 🎛️ **Run STA After Auto-Optimization**

```bash
sta Test_sta.conf
```

### 📸 **Improved Timing After Upsizing**

![image](Images/day4_sec5_open_sta_after_cell_replace.png)

*Figure 4.18: Slack improvements after replacing weaker cells with higher-drive versions*

---

### ⚙️ **Manual Commands (If Doing Interactive STA Debugging)**

```tcl
report_net -connections <net_name>
replace_cell <instance> <library>/<higher_drive_cell>
report_checks -from <start> -to <end> -through <instance>
```

> 💡 **Upsizing Concept**:
> Bigger transistors → lower resistance → faster switching → **reduced delay and better slack**

---

## 📝 **4.20 Writing Modified Netlist**

Once timing fixes are done, generate the updated netlist:

```bash
write_verilog /home/iraj/VLSI/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/31-10_05-39/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis.v
```

✅ New netlist has optimized drive strengths
✅ Used for STA + backend (floorplanning & PnR)

## 📊 Clock Buffer Specifications

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Drive Strength** | How strong buffer drives load |
| **Input Capacitance** | Load on previous stage |
| **Delay** | Propagation delay |
| **Slew** | Edge quality / rise-fall rate |

---

## 🔄 Buffer Optimization Results Summary

| Configuration | Setup Slack | Area | Trade-off |
|---------------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **With clkbuf_1** | Good | Lower | Balanced power/timing |
| **Without clkbuf_1** | Better | Higher | Improved timing, increased area |

---

## ⏱️ Setup & Hold Timing Fundamentals

### Timing Equations

```
Setup:  T_data_arrival + T_setup ≤ T_clock_arrival
Hold:   T_data_arrival ≥ T_clock_arrival + T_hold
```

### Timing Requirements

| Check | Requirement | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Setup** | Data before clock edge | Must arrive early |
| **Hold** | Data after clock edge | Must not change too fast |

**Success:** Both slacks must be positive ✅

## 💡 Key Concepts Explained

### 🕐 Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)

**What is CTS?**
Clock Tree Synthesis is the process of building a clock distribution network that delivers the clock signal from the clock source to all sequential elements (flip-flops) in the design.

**Why is CTS Important?**
1. **Skew Minimization**: Ensures all FFs receive clock at nearly the same time
2. **Timing Closure**: Required for accurate setup/hold analysis
3. **Power Optimization**: Balanced tree reduces power consumption
4. **Signal Integrity**: Maintains clock signal quality

**CTS Topologies:**
- **H-Tree**: Symmetric tree structure
- **X-Tree**: Diagonal distribution
- **Fishbone**: Spine with branches
- **Hybrid**: Combination of above

---

### ⚡ Setup vs Hold Timing

**Setup Time Check:**
```
Data must arrive BEFORE the clock edge (minus setup time)
Tdata_arrival + Tsetup < Tclock_arrival
```

**Hold Time Check:**
```
Data must remain stable AFTER the clock edge (plus hold time)
Tdata_arrival > Tclock_arrival + Thold
```

**Visual Representation:**
```
        Setup Check              Hold Check
            ↓                        ↓
    ────────●────────         ───●────────────
            │                    │
         Data must              Data must
         arrive before         remain stable after
         this point            this point
            │                    │
    ────────↑────────         ───↑────────────
         Clock Edge           Clock Edge
```

### 📊 Slack Analysis

**What is Slack?**
Slack = Required Time - Arrival Time

**Slack Types:**
- **Positive Slack (✅)**: Timing requirement met (Good!)
- **Zero Slack (✅)**: Exactly meeting timing (Acceptable)
- **Negative Slack (❌)**: Timing violation (Bad!)

**WNS vs TNS:**
- **WNS (Worst Negative Slack)**: Most critical path slack
- **TNS (Total Negative Slack)**: Sum of all negative slacks

---

### 🔌 Fanout Optimization

**What is Fanout?**
Number of gate inputs driven by a single output.

**High Fanout Problems:**
- ⚠️ Increased capacitive load
- ⚠️ Slower rise/fall times
- ⚠️ Higher delay
- ⚠️ Potential signal integrity issues

**Fanout Reduction Strategies:**
1. Add buffers/inverters
2. Upsize driving cell
3. Reduce maximum fanout constraint
4. Logic restructuring

---

## 🎓 Interview-Ready Talking Points

### Q1: Explain the complete flow of Day 4 lab.

**Answer:** "Day 4 focuses on pre-layout timing analysis and clock tree synthesis. The flow starts with configuring track-based grids and defining ports for a custom inverter cell. We generate a LEF file and integrate it into the OpenLane flow by updating config.tcl with library paths. After initial synthesis shows timing violations, we optimize using multiple strategies: setting SYNTH_STRATEGY to DELAY 3 for timing focus, enabling SYNTH_SIZING for automatic cell sizing, and reducing SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT to 4. We perform detailed pre-layout STA using OpenSTA, manually upsize critical cells, and write the modified netlist. After floorplan and placement, we run CTS to build a balanced clock tree, then perform post-CTS timing analysis in OpenROAD to verify both setup and hold timing are met."

---

### Q2: What is the importance of Clock Tree Synthesis?

**Answer:** "CTS is critical for three main reasons: First, it minimizes clock skew by ensuring all flip-flops receive the clock signal at nearly the same time, which is essential for proper circuit operation. Second, it enables accurate timing analysis because pre-CTS analysis uses ideal clocks, while post-CTS includes real insertion delays and skew. Third, a well-designed clock tree reduces power consumption since the clock network typically consumes 30-40% of total chip power. CTS builds a balanced tree structure using different buffer strengths - stronger buffers at the root and appropriate sizing at each level to drive the required load while maintaining signal integrity."

---

### Q3: How did you achieve timing closure in this lab?

**Answer:** "Timing closure was achieved through a systematic multi-step approach. First, I changed SYNTH_STRATEGY from AREA to DELAY 3, which makes the synthesizer prioritize timing over area. Second, I enabled SYNTH_SIZING to allow automatic cell upsizing and downsizing. Third, I reduced SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT from default to 4, which limits the load on driving cells and reduces delay. Fourth, I ran pre-layout STA to identify critical paths with high delay. Fifth, I manually upsized specific cells on the critical path using replace_cell commands in OpenSTA. Finally, I wrote the modified netlist back to overwrite the synthesis results. This combination of automated and manual optimizations successfully converted negative slack to positive slack, achieving timing closure."

---

### Q4: What is the difference between pre-layout and post-CTS timing analysis?

**Answer:** "Pre-layout STA assumes ideal clocks with zero delay and skew, analyzing only data paths. It's useful for early optimization but not accurate for final timing. Post-CTS analysis includes real clock tree delays - insertion delay from clock source to flip-flops and clock skew between different FFs. Post-CTS makes hold analysis meaningful because hold checks depend on clock skew. The timing numbers are more realistic post-CTS and closer to actual silicon performance. Pre-CTS typically shows better slack than post-CTS because real clock delays are added. That's why we need timing margin pre-CTS to accommodate clock tree overhead."

---

### Q5: Explain the fanout optimization strategy you used.

**Answer:** "Fanout is the number of inputs a single gate drives. High fanout increases capacitive load, causing slower transitions and higher delay. I optimized fanout by first checking the current SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT value, which was higher than optimal. I set it to 4, which is a balanced value - low enough to prevent excessive loading but not so low that it causes area explosion from too many buffers. After setting this constraint, I re-ran synthesis, which automatically inserted buffers on high-fanout nets and restructured logic. This reduced the delay on critical paths significantly. The tool balances between adding buffers (which increases area and power) and maintaining reasonable fanout (which improves timing)."

---

### Q6: What is cell upsizing and when would you use it?

**Answer:** "Cell upsizing means replacing a cell with a larger version from the same family but with higher drive strength. For example, replacing an AND2_X1 with AND2_X2 or X4. Larger cells have bigger transistors, which means lower output resistance and ability to charge output capacitance faster, reducing delay. I use upsizing on critical path cells identified through STA where delay is the bottleneck. The trade-off is increased area and power consumption. In the lab, I identified nets with huge delay using timing reports, then used replace_cell commands in OpenSTA to upsize the driving cell, then re-checked timing to confirm improvement. This targeted optimization is more efficient than global aggressive synthesis which would upsize everything."

---

### Q7: Why did run_floorplan fail and what was the workaround?

**Answer:** "The run_floorplan command sometimes fails due to specific configuration issues or version incompatibilities in the OpenLane flow. The workaround is to run the individual floorplan sub-steps manually: init_floorplan initializes the die area and core area based on configuration, place_io positions the I/O pins around the periphery according to pin placement strategy, and tap_decap_or inserts well tap cells for substrate connectivity and decap cells for local charge storage. Running these three commands sequentially achieves the same result as run_floorplan but gives more control and visibility into each sub-step. This approach is also useful for debugging when one specific sub-step fails."
